Docker installations can occur in many different ways depending on your hosting environment. This section will outline how to get it running on a local environment which can be used to learn how to run the formio server in a production docker environment.

#### Accessing the docker image
Once on the commercial plan, you will have access to the docker repository. Our docker images are located on dockerâ€™s hub.

#### Installing docker

You will first need to have docker installed. See [](http://docs.docker.com/v1.8/installation/) for more information.
