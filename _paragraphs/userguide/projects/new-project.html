New projects can be created from the USER PORTAL. Start by clicking the **New Project** button

Developers will be directed New Project page where they can add a Title, Domain, and Description for their new PROJECT.

<h4>Project Title</h4>
The Project Title is the name that will be used to identify and access a specific PROJECT throughout the entire life of the Project.  Keeping this in mind, a sensible Project naming convention should be utilized to clearly identify the Project as being associated with the corresponding CUSTOMER APPLICATION in which it will be used.  

<h4>Subdomain</h4>
Here is where a name space for the APIâ€™s for a given PROJECT is claimed.
Domain names must be unique for each PROJECT. There is a maximum of 24 characters per name, and special characters and spaces may not be used.

**Note**: Changing domain names after a PROJECT has gone live within an application will cause serious performance issues.

<h4>Description</h4>
The Project Description can be up to 125  characters and may be comprised of any letters, numbers, spaces, or other special characters. This description is simply used for reference within the PROJECT, and is not utilized elsewhere.
When done, click Create Project and your new project will be created.

When done, click **Create Project** and your new project will be created.
