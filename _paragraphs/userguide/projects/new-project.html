<h4>Project Title</h4>
<p>Enter the Project title in the Project Title field. This is the administrative name that will be used to refer to your project on form.io.</p>
<h4>Subdomain</h4>
<p>Enter a unique subdomain for your project. There are certain reserved subdomains that cannot be chosen and each project must have a unique domain name. This will be used for creating a unique API for your project. Choose carefully as this may break things if you change it later.</p>
<h4>Description</h4>
<p>Enter a description for your project. This is only for your help to remember what a project does.</p>
<p>When done, click <strong>Create Project</strong> and your new project will be created.</p>
