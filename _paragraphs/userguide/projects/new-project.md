New Projects can be created from the User Portal. Start by clicking the **New Project** button

Developers will be directed New Project page where they can add a Title, Domain Name, and Description for their new Project.

#### Project Title

The Project Title is the name that will be used to identify and access a specific Project throughout the entire life of the Project.  Keeping this in mind, a sensible Project naming convention should be utilized to clearly identify the Project as being associated with the corresponding customer Application in which it will be used.  

#### Subdomain

Here is where the namespace of the APIs for a given Project is claimed.
Domain names must be unique for each Project. There is a maximum of 24 characters per name, and special characters and spaces may not be used.

<p class="note">Changing domain names after a Project has gone live within an application will cause serious performance issues.</p>

#### Description

The Project Description can be up to 125 characters and may be comprised of any letters, numbers, spaces, or other special characters. This description is simply used for reference within the Project, and is not utilized elsewhere.

When done, click **Create Project** and your new project will be created.
