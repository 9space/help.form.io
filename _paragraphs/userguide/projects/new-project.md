New Projects can be created from the User Portal. Start by clicking the **New Project** button

Developers will be directed New Project page where they can add a Title, Domain Name, and Description for their new Project.

#### Project Title

The Project Title is the name that will be used to identify and access a specific Project throughout the entire life of the Project.  Keeping this in mind, a sensible Project naming convention should be utilized to clearly identify the Project as being associated with the corresponding customer Application in which it will be used.  

#### Description

The Project Description can be up to 512 characters and may be comprised of any letters, numbers, spaces, or other special characters. This description is simply used for reference within the Project, and is not utilized elsewhere.

When done, click **Create Project** and your new project will be created.

#### Project Template

Project Templates are predefined templates that specify what Resources, Forms, and Actions to automatically create for you. You may select from one of our existing project templates, or upload your own. Templates can be created by [exporting](#settings-project) an existing project. For more information on templates, see the [Project Templates](#project-templates) section.
