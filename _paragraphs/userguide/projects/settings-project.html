<p>Project settings are where specific configuration is set for a project. Currently this is only used for setting up the email gateway but this will be expanded to include additional settings in the future.</p>
<p>Project settings can be edited by going to the home page and clicking <strong>Settings</strong> next to your project. They can also be accessed when within a project by using the <strong>Settings</strong> tab at the top right of the page.</p>
