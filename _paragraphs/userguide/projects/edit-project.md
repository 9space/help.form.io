Projects can be edited by clicking directly on the project name within the list of PROJECT names. When within a project, you can also get to the edit page by clicking the <strong>Edit</strong> tab at the top right of the page.</p>

<h4>Subdomain</h4>
<p>Be careful changing the subdomain as it will change the base path of all integrations with your project. Only do this if you really know what you are doing.</p>
<p>When done, press the <strong>Save</strong> button</p>
