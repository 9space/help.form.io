Projects can be deleted by going to the home page when logged in and clicking the **trash icon** next to the project or by going to the General Settings page and clicking **Delete** at the bottom. Either way you will be prompted to ensure that you really did intend to delete the project.

<p class="warning">Deleting a project cannot be undone. Use caution.</p>
