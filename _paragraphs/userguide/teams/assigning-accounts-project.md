To add a team to a project, make sure the project is upgraded to **Team Pro** or **Commercial**. Then from the portal home page, click the *Add Team* button on the project.

You will then be presented with a form to add a team to a project and assign a permission.

Select which team you want to add and which permission. There are three options for permissions

- Read - This will only allow the team to read form definitions

- Write - This will allow the team to read and write form definitions.

- Admin - This will give the team all permissions including reading and writing forms and access to all data.

You can assign multiple teams to a single project. All members of a team have the same permissions that were assigned to that team.
