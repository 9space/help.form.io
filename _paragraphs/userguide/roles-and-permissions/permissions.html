<p>There are seven (7) PERMISSIONS that are assignable to any ROLES within a PROJECT: </p>
<ul>
  <li><b>Read All</b></li>
  <li><b>Update All</b></li>
  <li><b>Delete All</b></li>
  <li><b>Create Own</b></li>
  <li><b>Read Own</b></li>
  <li><b>Update Own</b></li>
  <li><b>Delete Own</b></li>
</ul>
<p>These PERMISSIONS grant USERS certain functions and behaviors that can be applied to a ROLE within a PROJECT and corresponding APPLICATION.  Each of these PERMISSIONS are defined below:</p>
<h4><ol><li>Read All Permissions</li></h4>
  <ul>
  <li>The Read All permission will allow a user, within a given Role, to view every Submission made within the Application, regardless of who owns that Submission.</li></ul>
