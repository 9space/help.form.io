#### ROLE Assignment
Once ROLE and Permissions have been configured, you can implement your configurations to a Resource or Form by adding a ROLE Assignment Action. To add ROLE Assignment, click the **Action** button on the top right of the page within a FORM or RESOURCE. Click the **Select an Action** button and choose **ROLE Assignment**.

Here there are several options to configure the Action. The **Resource  Association** option allows you to apply the ROLES to either New or Existing RESOURCES and FORMS. The **Action Type** option allows you to either Add or Remove the given ROLE to the RESOURCE or FORM. Lastly, the **ROLE** option allows you to select the desired ROLE you wish to assign to a given RESOURCE or FORM.

   Click the **Submit** button located at the bottom of the page to save your ROLE Assignment. All Actions, including ROLE Assignment, may be changed or deleted at any time by clicking the **Edit** and **Trash** button next to the action.
