Whenever you see the word APPLICATION used within this User Guide, it is referring to the APPLICATION that developers are building outside of **<form.io>**.
**<form.io>** MAJOR COMPONENTS are built within the **<form.io>** system, and are ultimately implemented within CUSTOMER APPLICATIONS.  It is important to distinguish a CUSTOMER APPLICATION from the work being completing within **<form.io>**.
When developers are working within **<form.io>** to create the **<form.io>** MAJOR COMPONENTS for their CUSTOMER APPLICATIONs, we refer to that work as PROJECTS.
