<p>Whenever you see the word APPLICATION used within this User Guide, it is refferring to the APPLICATION that developers are building outside of <b> <form.io> </b>.</p>
<p><b><form.io></b> MAJOR COMPONENTS are built within the <b><form.io></b> system, and are ultimately implemented within CUSTOMER APPLICATIONS.  It is important to distinguish a CUSTOMER APPLICATION from the work being completing within <b><form.io></b>.</p>
<p>When developers are working within <b><form.io></b> to create the <b><form.io></b> MAJOR COMPONENTS fortheir CUSTOMER APPLICATIONs, we refer to that work as PROJECTS.</p>
