Whenever you see the word APPLICATION used within this User Guide, it is referring to the APPLICATION that developers are building outside of &lt;**form.io**&gt;.
&lt;**form.io**&gt; MAJOR COMPONENTS are built within the &lt;**form.io**&gt; system, and are ultimately implemented within CUSTOMER APPLICATIONS.  It is important to distinguish a CUSTOMER APPLICATION from the work being completing within &lt;**form.io**&gt;.
When developers are working within &lt;**form.io**&gt; to create the &lt;**form.io**&gt; MAJOR COMPONENTS for their CUSTOMER APPLICATIONs, we refer to that work as PROJECTS.
