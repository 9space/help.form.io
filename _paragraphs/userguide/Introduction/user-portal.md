When a developer logs in to the **&lt;<span class="text-primary">form</span>.<span class="text-secondary">io</span>&gt;** platform, they arrive on their own individual **User Portal Page**. This page is the main page and has a growing amount of general content for the developer, as well as all of their specific Project information.
