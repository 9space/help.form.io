<p>When a new PROJECT is created, three (3)  ROLES are created by default: </p>
<ul>
  <li>Administrator</li>
  <li>Authenticated</li>
  <li>Anonymous</li>
</ul>
<p>The Anonymous ROLE is a special ROLE that defines access within an Application for a USER that is not authenticated. For example, a user that visits your application that has not yet registered or is not logged in.  <b>The Anonymous ROLE can be renamed, but not removed.</b></p>
