The Data page has two purposes. The first is to show the API usage for a project and the second is to allow viewing form submission data for a project.

#### Analytics

The analytics data for a project shows the number of submission calls that have occurred. All API operations dealing with submissions, including Create, Read, Update, and Delete each count as one API operation. Any operations on the form definition do not count as an API operation.

Analytics data can be drilled down into by clicking on the dot or using the dropdown to zoom in on the data.

#### Data Grid

Click on any Resource or Form to view the data that has been submitted to the corresponding API. This data is displayed in a data grid that allows filtering, sorting and editing the data. Click the arrow to the right of each column to sort or filter that column.
