Resources are reusable objects that can be used to create complex data structures within your application. The fields within a resource can be reused within other forms, as well as linked together to create complex nested resource relationships.

Form.io utilizes a form builder interface to create new resources, which not only creates the data model, but also automatically reflects that model onto a RESTful interface.
