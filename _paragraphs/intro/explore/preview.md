For projects from application templates, the Preview page allows seeing a working application without having to build and host an app somewhere. Each application template comes with a corresponding app that is used for the preview. This is an angular application that already has all the forms embedded and user authentication set up.

The Preview is a live working app that directly interfaces into your project. You can log in and create, edit and delete data within your project. Any changes made to the forms will immediately be reflected within the app.

When the time comes to make major changes to the app or to deploy to your own systems, the template can be cloned from github and all needed modifications can be made.
