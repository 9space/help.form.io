Follow these steps to create our first Human Resources Portal application.

  - ### Create an account at [https://form.io](https://portal.form.io){:target="_blank"}.
  - ### Create a new Project.
    Projects serve as a container for the Resources, Forms, Data, and Settings for a specific application you are building.

  - ### Provide project information
    Pick a name that is relevant to the project you are building, give it a description, select a template (in this example we
    will start with Default) and then press ***Create Project***

  - ### Modify the User Resource
    The Default template provides a User and Admin resource along with User Login, User Register, and Admin Login forms. We can start to get an understanding of how Form.io works by modifying our User resource for our particular application. Let's modify our ***User Resource*** to add a Phone Number and Home Address field.

  - ### Add Phone Number field.
    Using the Drag and Drop form builder interface, drag a ***Phone Number*** component onto the form.

  - ### Provide phone number field information.
    We need to create a Label and Placeholder for the phone number field.

  - ### Add home address field
    Next we will drag-and-drop the ***Address*** field onto the form and then provide the following information.

  - ### Press Save to update your User Resource
    Pressing Save on this Resource form will now add those fields to the User resource.

  - ### Create a "Request Time Off" form
    Click on the Forms section, and then click on ***New Form***

  - ### Use form builder to create form
    Using the form builder, drag and drop two **Date/Time** fields to create the **Start** and **End** times. You can also
    drag and drop a **Text Area** field to create reason for time off.
