As data is created, updated, or deleted with a form, actions can be configured to perform steps with that data. Form.io has many actions designed around getting your data where it needs to go.
 
Some of the types of actions that can happen are:

  - Email - Sending an email with the form information either to the person submitting the form or to a project administrator.
  
  - Data Sync - Sending the data either to an external database or external service like Microsoft Office 365 or Hubspot.
  
  - Authentication - Performing User authentication with an external service such as github, facebook or twitter.
  
  - Webhook - Calling a custom URL in your system to do something with the form data.
  
This allows the complete circle of using form.io. The forms are created, embedded, rendered, sent to form.io for validation and then sent to wherever you need the data to be.
