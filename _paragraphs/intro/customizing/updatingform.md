Once you have a project created and have explored the options available in the portal, it is time to see form updates in action.

Start by going to the edit page of any form that is contained within the project. Create or edit a field on that form.

Be sure to save the form after editing it.

Now go directly to the Preview page on the left side of the portal. You should immediately see the changes you made to the form.

As you continue to make changes to the forms within your project, you can view the changes directly in the preview.
