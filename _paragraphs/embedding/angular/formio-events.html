<p>The formio module emits events at various times. These events are designed to allow developers to respond to events that occur within the formio generated forms. For example, after a user creates a new submission, you may want to change the view to display that submission or send them to a thank you page. You can do this by responding to the <strong>$scope.$on('formSubmission', function(err, submission) { //do something })</strong> event</p>
<h4>formSubmission</h4>
<p>The formSubmission event is called whenever a form is submitted. This can be either a create or an edit.</p>
<h4>formError</h4>
<p>The formError event is called whenever client side validation fails.</p>
<h4>formLoad</h4>
<p>The formLoad event is called whenever a form is loaded from the form.io server. It is useful to customize forms before they are displayed.</p>
<h4>submissionView</h4>
<p>The submissionView event is called whenever a submission is being rendered for display.</p>
<h4>submissionEdit</h4>
<p>The submissionEdit event is called whenever the edit view is rendered.</p>
<h4>submissionLoad</h4>
<p>The submissionLoad event is called whenever a submission is loaded from the server.</p>
<h4>submissionsLoad</h4>
<p>The submissionsLoad event is called whenever multiple submissions are loaded from the server.</p>
<h4>submissionDelete</h4>
<p>The submissionDelete event is called whenever the delete dialogue is called.</p>
<h4>cancel</h4>
<p>The cancel event is called whenever a delete dialogue is cancelled.</p>
<h4>delete</h4>
<p>The delete event is called whenever a delete dialogue is confirmed and a submission is deleted.</p>
