<p><strong>form</strong> - Alternatively, you can pass in the form definition as an attribute on the formio directive.</p>
<p><strong>submission</strong> - If a submission has already been loaded, it can be passed in as an attribute.</p>
<p><strong>formAction</strong> - To use a custom form action you can specify it as an attribute. This will change where the submit event goes to.</p>
<p><strong>resourceName</strong> - The resource name is used in the delete dialogue for confirmation. It can be used to change the default.</p>
<p>The delete directive will show a delete confirmation dialogue and will either cancel or delete based on the selection by the user. Events are triggered for either a <strong>cancel</strong> or a <strong>delete</strong>.</p>
