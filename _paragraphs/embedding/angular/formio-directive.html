<h4>Attributes</h4>
<p><strong>src</strong> - The src attribute is used to pass in the path to the form or form and submission to be displayed.</p>
<p><strong>formAction</strong> - To use a custom form action you can specify it as an attribute. This will change where the submit event goes to.</p>
<p><strong>form</strong> - Alternatively, you can pass in the form definition as an attribute on the formio directive.</p>
<p><strong>submission</strong> - If a submission has already been loaded, it can be passed in as an attribute.</p>
<p><strong>readOnly</strong> - Forms can be made read only which can be useful for viewing submission results.</p>
<p>Form.io forms can be embedded direction into your angular application with one line of code. Simply pass in the name of the form to the directive and the Formio module will render out the form for you. If you only pass in the form name, a form with default values will be rendered. This is useful for <strong>Creating</strong> operations.</p>
<pre><code>&lt;formio src="{formName}"&gt;&lt;/formio&gt;</code></pre>
<p>You can also render out a form for a previous submission with the values already set in it. This is useful for <strong>Editing</strong> functionality to allow users to edit previous submissions.</p>
<pre><code>&lt;formio src="{formName}/submission/{submission_id}"&gt;&lt;/formio&gt;</code></pre>
