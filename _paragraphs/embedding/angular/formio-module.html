<p>In order to embed your Form.io project in your angular application, you will need to add the formio Module. The ngFormio Module will create all scopes, providers and directives needed to embed Formio components within your app.</p>
<h4>Bower</h4>
<p>To add with bower, add formio to the bower dependencies and run <strong>bower install</strong></p>
<h4>Adding the dependencies</h4>
Form.io requires some dependencies on your HTML page to work properly. All of these dependencies can be found by looking at the <a href="https://github.com/formio/ngFormio/blob/develop/bower.json#L25"></a><strong>formio</strong> bower.json</a> file. The easiest way to include all of these dependencies within your webpage is to use a tool called <a href="https://github.com/taptapship/wiredep">Wiredep</a>.
<h4>Wiredep</h4>
First you need to install wiredep.
```
npm install --save wiredep
```

Next, add the following to your HTML page.
```
<html>
<head>
  <!-- bower:css -->
  <!-- endbower -->
</head>
<body>
  <!-- bower:js -->
  <!-- endbower -->
</body>
</html>
```

Next, type the following in terminal to wire up all the dependencies.

```
$ node
```
(press enter)
```
> require('wiredep')({ src: 'index.html' });
```
(press enter)

This should then wire all the dependencies into your page. 
<h4>Example Page</h4>
To see this in action, here is a page with all the dependencies already wired up for reference.

<h4>Initialize Angular</h4>
The next step is to initialize <strong>formio</strong> within your Angular application.  This requires you to add the following to your angular.js declaration.

```
angular.module('myApp', ['formio']);
```

And of course, if you are not using Angular for your full application, you will need to make sure that the application name is provided on the ```<body>``` tag.

```
<body ng-app="myApp">
  
</body>
```
