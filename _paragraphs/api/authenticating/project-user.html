<p>In order to authenticate as a project user, you will need to set up a User Resource within your application and create Register and Login forms with the appropriate Authentication Actions.</p>
<p>Once you have the User Resource and Forms set up, you can authenticate client users within your application. In order to do this, perform a POST request to 'https://{appname}.form.io/app/api/{userresource}/{loginform}/submission' with the email and password passed in a data object.</p>
<p>Doing client user authentication is much more dependent on how you built out your application so replace {variables} with the specifics from your application.</p>
