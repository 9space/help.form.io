Resources are a way of defining an object within **&lt;<span class="text-primary">form</span>.<span class="text-secondary">io</span>&gt;**. Currently this is done by adding Form components to a Resource. Follow the instructions for Forms when creating Resources. The Form components that are placed onto a Resource determine what the Resource object looks like.

The primary difference between Resources and Forms is that Resources can be embedded in other Resources and Forms while Forms cannot be.

Use Resources when you are creating a primary object that you will be interacting with in your system such as a User, a Movie or a Todo Item.

<p class="note">Resources are changing to make them more different from Forms. Don't worry though, the upgrade will be seamless.</p>
