<p class="note"> Roles and Permissions are a way of granting access to any portion of an Application within Form.io. Roles and Permissions are configured on a per Application basis, and must be defined for anyone seeking access to an Application or Application entity. Roles are assigned to submission entities and have their permissions defined within each Application entity.
Upon creating a new Application, three Roles will be created: Administrator, Authenticated, and Anonymous. These Roles have no access by default, but are created to ease the process of configuring Roles and Permissions. The default roles can be changed or removed with the exception of the Anonymous role. The Anonymous role is a special role that defines access within an Application for a user that is not authenticated. The Anonymous role can be edited, but not removed.
There are eight Permissions that are available on any Application or Application entity: create_all, read_all, update_all, delete_all, create_own, read_own, update_own, and delete_own. These Permissions relate to the possible manipulation of entities that a user can either own or not own. Every entity that allows permissions, Applications, Forms, Resources, and Submissions, will have the eight possible permissions listed so that Roles can be added to their corresponding access list.
When an entity is accessed by a user, and the user has one of the listed Roles available to complete the operation they are attempting, access will be granted. If no Roles are defined to have permissions on an entity, only the owner of the entity or the Application itself will have access to the entity; By default, the Application owner will have access to every entity associated with their Application. To get ownership of an entity, the entity must be created with the create_own permissions, which will assign the user initiating the request to be its owner, or a user can be defined as the owner of an entity, if they are specified as such during a create_all operation. The _own permissions will restrict access to any entity that a user is defined to be the owner of. .</p>
