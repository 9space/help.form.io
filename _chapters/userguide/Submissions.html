<p>Submissions are the values that were submitted to the form you built. These can be thought of as "objects" within the system and operate very much like them. You can get to an administrative view of submissions by editing a form and clicking on the <strong>Submissions</strong> tab in the top right of the page. You can also embed submissions directly using a &lt;formio&gt; angular directive or you can query the api directly. See <a href="/embedding/">Application Embedding</a> and <a href="/api">Developer API</a> for more information.</p>
