<p>Resources are a way of defining an object within Form.io. Currently this is done by adding form components to a resource. Follow the instructions for Forms when creating Resources. The form components that are placed onto a resource determine what the resource object looks like.</p>
<p>The primary difference between resources and forms is that resource can be embedded in other resources and forms while forms cannot be.</p>
<p class="note">Resources are changing to make them more different from forms. Don't worry though, the upgrade will be seamless.</p>
