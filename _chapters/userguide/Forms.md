Forms are the primary interface with the system in form.io. Design a Form by dragging and dropping Form components onto the Form. Which Form components are placed onto a Form determines what the Form object looks like. You do not need to create an API before creating the Form. A compatible API will automatically be built out for you as you design your Form.
