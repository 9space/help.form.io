PROJECTS are the main working areas within the &lt;**form.io**&gt; platform used by developers to build the &lt;**form.io**&gt; MAJOR COMPONENTS that will ultimately be implemented within their own CUSTOMER APPLICATIONS.   The &lt;**form.io**&gt; system enables developers to easily  build a service for their IOS, Android, Windows apps, and websites that all interact with the same &lt;**form.io**&gt; MAJOR COMPONENTS.

Each PROJECT is typically associated with a single corresponding CUSTOMER APPLICATION.

When a developer begins work within the &lt;**form.io**&gt; platform, they typically begin by creating a PROJECT.  Each PROJECT will contain all of the MAJOR COMPONENTS for the CUSTOMER APPLICATION such as FORMS, RESOURCES, ROLES, etc.
