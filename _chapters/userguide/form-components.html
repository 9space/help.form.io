<p>A form component is the way that data is collected and displayed within the system. Form components define the type of widget that users will enter the data into the system and will automatically add a property to the resource endpoint to interact with the form component.</p>
<p>To add a form component to a form, drag and drop the component from the left column into the desired location within the form. You will then be presented with a settings form for the component.</p>
