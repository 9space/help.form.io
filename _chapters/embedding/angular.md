<p>Form.io has an Angular module that allows building out forms and apis on Form.io and then embedding everything directly into your application with one line of code. When using this method, there is no other work needed to allow users to create, edit and delete resources within your application and when you make changes to the forms, they immediately update within your application.</p>
