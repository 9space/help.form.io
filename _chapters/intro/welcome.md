**&lt;<span class="text-primary">form</span>.<span class="text-secondary">io</span>&gt;** offers the first development platform that builds forms & APIs in one simple step. **&lt;<span class="text-primary">form</span>.<span class="text-secondary">io</span>&gt;** is a revolutionary form & API service that enables web application developers to easily create next generation Web 3.0 applications. Think of it as a form builder for developers that also provides them the corresponding APIs. **&lt;<span class="text-primary">form</span>.<span class="text-secondary">io</span>&gt;** finally bridges the ever increasing gap between the application interface and the backend API server. Developers use our simple drag & drop interface to create Resources and Forms for their front end applications, which automatically configures the RESTful API to support them, all in one easy step.

Each field dragged on to the Form creates its own definition, behavior, and validation criteria which is executed on both the front and back end simultaneously to create a seamless application experience. Resource fields can also be reused within multiple Form interfaces, and allow for nested resource relationships which are necessary to create complex applications.

Our platform also provides a number of configurable Actions that allow for customized behaviors for each form submission such as authentication, email or SMS text communications, Integration to back-end systems or external data sources with ease.

But the **WOW** moment comes with our powerful embedded technology which provides a single HTML element called **&lt;<span class="text-primary">form</span>.<span class="text-secondary">io</span>&gt;** which enables a dynamic embedding of that form within your application. With this technology, the same schema is used to not only render the form dynamically but also connects that form with the auto generated REST API automatically. And it’s as easy as embedding an image!

##### You build the app – ***we handle the FORM I/O***

#### Deployment Options:
- Take advantage of the **&lt;<span class="text-primary">form</span>.<span class="text-secondary">io</span>&gt;** Hosting services. With this option, all you need to do is create your project and embed the tag.
- Utilize **&lt;<span class="text-primary">form</span>.<span class="text-secondary">io</span>&gt;** to build your application including your API, documentation, validation and **&lt;<span class="text-primary">form</span>.<span class="text-secondary">io</span>&gt;** which will point to your server for in house hosting. With this option you will need to install:
  - Docker
  - Mongo DB

We take care of the rest.

**Now let's build an app together and show you how everything works:**
